### Project Title
Examining weather trends for Brussels and the world

### Description
For this project local and global temperature data is analyzed and the temperature
trends between Brussels and a selection of other cities (Berlin, Brussels, New York,
Tokyo and Wellington) are compared. The goal is to create visualizations and a short
write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature
trends and the selected cities. <br>

This short report, in form of a jupyter notebook, provides an overview of the
steps taken to prepare the retrieved data to be visualized and observed, as
outlined for the project.
